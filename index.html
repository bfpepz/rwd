    <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>In the year of our <a href="lorde.jpg">Lorde</a> 2017, more than half of all traffic on the web is coming from mobile devices. What does that mean for web design? It must be <em>responsive</em>. </p>
     
    <h2>What does it mean to make a responsive site?</h2>
    <p>Responsive design is the purposeful construction of sites that will conform and optimize to a variety of displays and devices. It is composed of three key elements:</p> 
     <ul>  
      <li>flexible, grid layout</li>
      <li>flexible images and media</li>
      <li>media queries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the core of desinging a responsive site is relative sizing. Text, elements, media - relative units are key to creating a site  that will display effectively on a desktop monitor, phone, tablet, or even the browser of a gaming console. Responsive design solves the problem of creating a cohesive user experience across all devices.
